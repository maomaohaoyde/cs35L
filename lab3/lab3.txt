wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
I used wget to download the software

tar -xzvf ~/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
I used command tar to decompress the file I downloaded

mkdir coreutilsInstall 
the directory "coreutilsInstall" did not already exist, so I used mkdir to create it to install the software under this directory

pwd
pwd prints out current directory. I used it to see the absolute directory of the directory I just created

ls
ls lists information about the files starting in the current directory. I used this because I wanted to know if the directory "coreutils-7.6" existed

cd coreutils-7.6
cd changes the current directory. So I used it to enter coreutils-7.6  to install software

cat INSTALL | less
I read the instruction in INSTALL

./configure —prefix=/u/eng/class/classong/coreutilsInstall
If I don’t change the directory, the software will be automatically installed into bin which I do not have access to. So I change the prefix to the directory I just created.

make
make efficiently compiles files and keeps them up-to-date. I use it to compile all the program code and creates executables in current temporary directory

make install
make install makes utility searches for a label named install within the Makefile, and executes only that section of it. I used it to install the software under coreutilsInstall directory


find -name ls
Find -name help me find the files that contains the keyword and print out their directory. I used it to find where ls is written.

cd ./src
I changed the directory to which ls file belongs to

./ls -l
I ran the local ls to see the time format

cd coreutils-7.6
cd changes the current directory. So I used it to enter coreutils-7.6  to patch ls

man patch
man shows the man page of certain commands. I used it to understand pnum for patch command 

emacs patch_file
copy text into the file from the line —-- a/src/ls to the end line —-

patch -p1 <patch_file
patch applies the diff file. I used it to apply the modified version

make
compile the new version

cd ~
go back to home directory

touch –t 201309090909.0909 test_file
change the modified time of the test_file

/u/eng/class/classong/coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
/u/eng/class/classong/coreutilsInstall/bin
see the if modification works
