srot13u spends the most real time and time on system call comparing with other two because it makes the most system calls.
srot13s spends less real time than srot13u but still a lot more time than srot13 because it spends a lot of time on user mode function calls.
srot13 is the fastest because it makes the least system calls and functions calls.
